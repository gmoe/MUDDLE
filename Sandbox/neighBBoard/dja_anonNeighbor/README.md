Another look at my recently finished drawing, a companion piece to the Cyntoia Brown portrait (which you can see in previous posts) that I made last year; both are from a new body of work entitled Facing the Music, focusing on individuals who have been abused, brutalized, and misunderstood by the prevailing systems of power in their respective times. Each drawing in this series also utilizes contemporary lyrics (Talking Heads, in this case) to highlight a particular aspect of the subject's plight.

Also, this drawing kinda kicked my ass. In the best way.

You can see more from Facing the Music on my website, www.damienjamesart.com, or follow the link in my bio.
